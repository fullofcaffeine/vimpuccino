h1. The awesome Vim config files

This is my own Caffeinated (with some 2% milk and foam) VIM config files + plugins. It is based on the awesome Vim-For-Rails from Federico Ramallo.

It's optimized for Ruby and Rails, but has support for other languages, such as haXe.

It's work in progress. Feedback welcome.


h1. Thanks

My special kudos to Federico for his initial work on the scripts, architecture and for gathering the bulk of plugins.
